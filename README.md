# Food-Delivery-App-data-Analysis
In this project, I have worked on a real-world dataset of zomato, one of the most used food ordering platforms. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights.   

1. Pre-processing the data.
Data Pre-processing is one of the important steps in data analytics because data that is not processed can lead to different unwanted results when the data will be used for further applications. This task includes sub-tasks such as handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, datatype transformation, removing duplicates, etc. The tasks to be performed for cleaning the data set are given below:

Removing Unwanted Columns
Removing unwanted columns refers to the process of eliminating irrelevant or unnecessary columns from a dataset. This can improve data analysis and visualization by reducing clutter and focusing on the most important information. It involves identifying and selecting the columns to be removed and executing the removal process using tools like programming languages, database management systems, or spreadsheet software.

2. SQl Queries to gain different business insights

3. Power Bi report for better visualization
